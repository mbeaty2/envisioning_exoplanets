This repository holds all code necessary to execute my thesis for the Masters of Science in Data Science and AI at the University of Arts London. This project sought to fine-tune Stable Diffusion to generate scientifically supported images of distant exoplanets. Stable Diffusion was fine-tuned using generated prompts based on the data within NASA's Confirmed Exoplanet dataset and images from NASA's Image and Video Library. The prompts were generated by translating the numeric data within the Exoplanet dataset to textual descriptions interpreting that data. A series of different translations occured to create one prompt. This process was repeated to create four total prompts that were then used to fine-tune Stable Diffusion. The results of these models were evluated to determine the best model for this type of scientifically backed image generation. 

The results and evaluation can be found in the thesis report. This repository, instead, holds the following documents:

1. getting_images: A notebook used to search and save images from NASA's Image and Video Library
2. prompt_generator_functions: A notebook used to clean and process the data, translate values, and generate prompts
3. training_data_prompts: Training Dataset as a .csv file updated with numeric data and the generated prompts
4. exoplanet_data_prompts: Exoplanet Dataset as a .csv file updated with the generated prompts
5. getting_metadata_file: A notebook used to acquire the necessary metadata file used to train Stable Diffusion
